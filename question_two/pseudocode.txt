Input
    - Flight details: id, priority, type (landing/takeoff), status (emergency/VIP/diverted/regular)
    - Weather forecast: condition (sunny, storm, fog), date
    - Emergency buffer list (initially empty)
Process
    1. Create a list called `scheduledFlights` combining both landing and takeoff flight data.
    2. Check each flight:
        - If emergency or diverted → assign highest priority (0).
        - If VIP → assign high priority (1).
        - If regular → assign default priority (2 or 3).
        - If weather is poor (e.g. storm or fog), increase priority value for non-emergency flights (to delay).
    3. Insert all flights into a priority queue sorted by priority value.
    4. While the queue is not empty:
        - Pop the highest-priority flight.
        - If weather conditions allow the flight:
            - Process (takeoff or land).
            - Log "Processed flight ID: X".
        - If not:
            - Delay flight, update its time, and reinsert into the queue.
        - If emergency buffer is needed, move the flight to emergency buffer.
    5. Once all main flights are processed:
        - Loop through emergency buffer:
            - If weather is safe, process each flight and log it.
Output
    - Ordered log of all flights processed: ID, type (landing/takeoff), priority, and status.
    - Separate log of emergency buffer usage (if any).
