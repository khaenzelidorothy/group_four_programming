# group_four_programming
**#Overview**
This repository is a collaborative group project focused on developing programs that address three specific questions. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs.

**#Question One**
In this question, we create a comprehensive Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript program that helps tourists plan their travel itineraries while optimizing their time and experiences based on personal interests, local event schedules, and transportation options. The system will also provide dynamic suggestions that adjust to real-time feedback, such as weather changes, unexpected closures, and current attraction crowd levels.

**#Question Two**
This project is a flight scheduling system designed for an international airport. It simulates real-time prioritization of flight takeoffs and landings while dynamically accounting for changing weather conditions, emergency scenarios, and efficient operation logistics.
