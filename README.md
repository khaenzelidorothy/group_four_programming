# group_four_programming
**#Overview**
This repository is a collaborative group project focused on developing programs that address three specific questions. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs.
**#Question One**
In this question we create a comprehensive program in Kotlin,Python and Javascript language that helps tourists plan their travel itineraries while optimizing their time and experiences based on personal interests,local event schedules,and transportation options.The system will also provide dynamic suggestions that adjust to real-time feedback,such as weather changes,unexpected closures,and current crowd levels at attractions.
