**#Overview**
This repository is a collaborative group project focused on developing programs that address three specific questions. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs.

**#Question One**
To create an algorithm that helps tourists plan their travel itineraries while optimizing their time and experiences based on personal interests, local event schedules, and transportation options, we can outline a solution that includes pseudocode and implementations in JavaScript, Python, and Kotlin. This system will also provide dynamic suggestions that adjust to real-time feedback, such as weather changes, unexpected closures, and current crowd levels at attractions.

In this question, we create a comprehensive program that combines Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript to help tourists plan their travel itineraries, optimizing their time and experiences based on personal interests, local event schedules, and transportation options. The system will also provide dynamic suggestions that adjust to real-time feedback, such as weather changes, unexpected closures, and current attraction crowd levels.

**#Question Two**
Develop a comprehensive program to schedule the landing and takeoff of flights at an international airport. Your algorithm must account for varied factors such as changing weather conditions, the priority of the flight(e.g, emergency landings, VIP transport), and runway availability. The goal is  to minimize delays and maximize safety and efficiency in air traffic handling. Considerations include managing the sequence of the  flights efficiently, handling unexpected flight diversions, and maintaining a buffer for emergencies.

This project is a flight scheduling system designed for an international airport. It simulates real-time prioritization of flight takeoffs and landings while dynamically accounting for changing weather conditions, emergency scenarios, and efficient operation logistics.
